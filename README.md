# BFBotWitness
A witness and event hook for BFBotManager. This was designed for my specific use case, works using a pub/sub architecture watching storage files used by the BFBotManager to emit messages to subscribers. The current producers/subscribers send any new or changed bets to a local server over https while backing up the storage files used by the manager.

## TODO
1. If there's any interest, adapt into a more user friendly library.
2. Rework the O(N^3) comparison function
3. Integration tests.
